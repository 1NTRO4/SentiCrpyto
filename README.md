# SentiCrpyto
In this Project I intend confirming our hypothesis that distilBERT an optimised version of BERT is best suited for sentiment analysis of cryptocurrency based News headline

I constructed a cryptocurrency based dictionary that is made of the top 200 crypto currencies and their abbreviations according to thier market capitalization. 192 crypto exchanges also made the list. This dictionary was then used to identify crypto currency entities from news headlines datasets and their sentiments determined using Textblob. Various BERT models were then trained and performance evaluated using this dataset. The best performing model would then be deployed for sentiments analysis in finance, particulary to crypto currency news headlines.

Finally a user interface is added to deploy the model for test/use
